# eBanker: Web-Based ATM Simulator

This is a simple interactive web-based ATM simulator called **eBanker**. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, it simulates basic ATM functionalities such as login, check balance, deposit, withdraw, view transaction history, and displays a dynamic balance chart.

## 🔧 Features

* User login with card number and PIN
* Dashboard UI with animated interactions
* Deposit and withdraw funds with prompt input
* Real-time balance updates
* Transaction history view
* Dynamic line graph for balance over time using Chart.js
* Clean and responsive Bootstrap-based UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Bootstrap 4)
* JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
* Chart.js (for dynamic graph)

## 📁 File Structure

```
project-folder/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with embedded JS and CSS
├── README.md           # This file
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc).
2. Enter dummy card number and PIN (you can input any values).
3. Use the dashboard to deposit, withdraw, or view transaction history.

> **Note**: This project does not include backend or persistent storage. All data resets upon page reload.

## 📈 Sample Use Case

## 🧩 Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Backend integration using Python Flask
* Database for persistent storage (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB)
* Secure login with validation
* Language selection or accessibility options
